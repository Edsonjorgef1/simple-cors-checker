# simple-cors-checker
Just a basic implementation of cors - It's more of an helper to Backend Devs while developing an API - And need to test the routes and avoid CORS while on production. 

My little tweaks on the idea:
- Added a Form with an input
- Organized success and error messages on DOM
- Check the returned data on DOM and also on the console
